# Blender - ID Mask Tools

A set of tools to quickly create ID masks for meshes.

### What is this?
For usage in specific programs like Substance Painter, its useful to create a mask for specific parts for your mesh, so you can easily make out parts of the mesh, to f.E. apply a mterial. 
You can specify colors in color attributes that define "IDs" for specific parts of the mesh, which you can then use in different programs.

Currently this workflow requires you to assign them tediously by using a mixture of Edit Mode and Vertex Paint to paint the mesh correctly. 

This plugin tries to fix that, by providing proper tools for it. The most important is probably the [ID Mask Editor](docu/features/id_mask_editor.md), that allows you to quickly add IDs to faces all within the Edit Mode.
